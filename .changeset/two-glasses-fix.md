### Deprecated Components

In 0.4, we have deprecated the following headless components:

- Drawer
- Breadcrumb
- Action Button
- Button Group
- Toast
- Tooltip
- Card
- Badge
- Spinner
- Rating
- Checkbox

Most of these components were in a pre-alpha state, duplicates from the styled kit, or were not yet ready for production use. They were lying around in the codebase for a while, and we have gained many insights since then on creating accessible, unstyled, and performant components.

You can expect the **Toast** and the **Tooltip** to come back with a much more polished form in a future release.
