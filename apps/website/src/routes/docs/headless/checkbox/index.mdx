# Checkbox (Two-State)

Allows users to visually select an option by checking it.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## Anatomy

<AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'Checkbox.Root',
      description:
        'Defines the component boundary and exposes its internal logic AND must wrap over all other parts',
    },
    {
      name: 'Checkbox.Indicator',
      description:
        'Wrapper that automatically shows its children when true and hides them when false',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Controlled Checkbox

You can bind the internal value of a checkbox to a user-defined signal:

<Showcase name="controlled" />

Do keep in mind that the inital value of the signal WILL affect the initial value of the checkbox.

In the example below, the left checkbox was bindided to a signal with an inital value of false while the right checkbox was bindded to a signal with an inital falue of true.

<Showcase name="controlled-values" />

## Customization & Caveats

The Checkbox is made from the ground up to be as customizable as possible.

You can define your own CSS classes on every part of the component as if it were a normal div element. You can even define any valid HTML as your icon, but keep in mind that any child of the Checkbox Indicator is removed from the accesibilyti tree. This is done to prevent text, or emojis, that are meant to be used as icons from being added to the label of the Checkbox (see [automatic labeling](#automatic-labeling) for more info).

### Automatic Labeling

Due to the implementation of the Checkbox element being a div with the role of checkbox, any text present inside the Checkbox Root is interpreted as the checkbox label.

This also means that any text tag is stripped from its semantic meaning. In other words, passing an h1 tag is treated the same as passing a p tag: they are both treated as if you passed no tag at all. See [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/checkbox_role#all_descendants_are_presentational) section of MDN for a more detailed explenation.
