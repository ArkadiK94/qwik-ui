# Introduction

<p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-500 font-semibold text-lg mt-[-8px]">An open source toolkit for building accessible, customizable, and rich user interfaces with Qwik.</p>

Qwik UI is a low-level component library built with a strong emphasis on performance, accessibility, customization, and developer experience. It aims to give the developer more time focusing on what matters most, building the app!

This library serves as a foundation of your design system, providing the missing or non-existent functionality from native solutions.


<Note status="warning">
**Woah, why is there a 0 by the version?**

Qwik UI is in its beta phase - it's like a roller coaster, thrilling and full of surprises! **Expect new features and some breaking changes** until we reach version 1.0. So, buckle up and enjoy the ride. üèçÔ∏è

## Vision

In 2024, developers should not have to recreate the same [WAI-Aria Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) from scratch. Building custom components is challenging, and developers shouldn't need to reinvent common UI patterns.

Our aim is to ensure Qwik UI is not just an effective, but also a simple and reliable choice for your applications. 

## Features

### Server-Side benefits with Resumability

Unlike many other solutions that focus solely on client-side components, Qwik UI takes advantage of the server, the client, and the concept of resumability.

This means that Qwik UI can operate with any meta-framework that supports Qwik, including the full framework benefits. At the time of writing, that includes [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/qwikcity/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Embracing native first

Qwik values HTML as the source of truth, and this principle extends to Qwik UI components. We appreciate and adopt the excellent work done by the [Open UI Group](https://open-ui.org/) when appropriate.

<br /> 

This approach also encompasses future native APIs. Users of Qwik UI might find themselves using components that can be gradually adopted into the native specification. This implies that, eventually, these custom patterns might not need any JavaScript.

<Note status="info">
For instance, [Qwik UI's popover component](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/pull/445) uses the native Popover API on supported browsers. The Anchor API is also incrementally adoptable.

### Accessibile at its Core

Accessibility is at the heart of the Headless Kit. Each component in the library
has been meticulously crafted to meet the highest accessibility standards,
ensuring that your web applications are inclusive and cater to users of all
abilities. By choosing the Headless Kit, you're taking an important step towards
creating a more accessible web.

## Why Choose the Headless Kit?

The Headless Kit allows you to apply your own CSS, making it easy to achieve the
look and feel you desire for your Qwik web applications. And you're getting all of
the logic and behavior out of the box!

## Seamless Integration with Qwik

The Headless Kit is designed to work hand-in-hand with the Qwik framework. This
means that, as a developer, you can enjoy the performance benefits and SEO 
advantages of Qwik while having complete control over the appearance of your web
application. It's the best of both worlds!
