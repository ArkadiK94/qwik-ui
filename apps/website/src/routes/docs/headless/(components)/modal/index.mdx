# Modal

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Modal content is placed in the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer), rendering the underneath content as [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) / non-interactive.

<ShowExample example="hero"/>

The modal makes use of HTML's `dialog` element, which has great support in [every major browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog). 

> For non-modal UI elements, it is preferred to use [Qwik UI's popover component](../../../docs/headless/popover/) *(in progress)*. In the near future, Qwik's popover component can be applied to the most-semantically-relevant HTML element, including the `<dialog>` element itself for non-modal dialogs.

Modals are used when an important choice needs to be made in the application. The rest of the content isn't interactive until a certain action has been performed.

## Dialog extendability

<ShowExample example="inspect"/>

The Qwik UI Modal component is built on top of the `dialog` element. To see additional capabilities of the dialog, take a look at the [offical MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog).

Our goal is to fill existing gaps, ensuring your modal is a11y compliant and enriched with HTML spec features, reducing reliance on Qwik UI maintainers.

### Attribute example

<ShowExample example="autoFocus" />

Above is an example of the `autofocus` attribute used to focus the 2nd input when the dialog is opened. 

> When adding properties on `<Modal />`, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself. 

## Open or close the modal

To open or close the modal, we can use `bind:show`, a custom signal bind that leverages the [bind](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/rendering/#bind-attribute) syntax in Qwik.

<ShowExample example="hero" />

`showSig` is a signal that we pass into our Modal component to customize when the modal can be open or closed.

The above example sets the signal to true when the button with the text **Open Modal** is clicked, then closed whenever a button inside of the modal is clicked.

> Custom signal binds can be thought of as a remote control for a television. Just as you use a remote control to change channels, adjust volume, or turn the TV on or off, custom signal binds allow you to control the state of a component, such as opening or closing a modal, from a distance.

## The top layer

<ImgTestImage class="rounded-xl mb-6" />

In Chrome and Edge, a `top layer` UI button is shown in the dev tools. This means the element content is placed above any other content on the page, preventing any overflow or style issues. 

The top layer is used in Qwik UI, whenever a modal or popover is used. Popovers can be applied to any semantic element, modals in Qwik UI are tied to the `dialog` element.

> The previous implementation of modals required the use of [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal), the top layer pseudo class is a **native solution** to this problem. No more z-index wars!

## Backdrops

To add a modal backdrop, the `::backdrop` pseudo element can be utilized. [Backdrops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) are right underneath top layer elements.

By default, the `dialog` element comes with a subtle backdrop, below is a snippet customizing the backdrop background along with the [backdrop filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) css property.

<BackdropCss />

<ShowExample example="backdrop"/>

Styling a [backdrop in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur) can be done using the `:backdrop` selector. In the example code below, we've changed the brightness based on dark or light mode, along with a blur.

<ShowExample example="hero"/>

## Backdrop dismiss

By default, modals can be dismissed by clicking on the backdrop. This can be changed with the `closeOnBackdropClick` prop.

<ShowExample example="backdropClose"/>

Above is an example of a modal that does not dismiss when the backdrop is clicked, where `closeOnBackdropClick` is set to false.

## Alertdialog

An alert dialog is a modal that interrupts user workflow to convey critical information and obtain a response. It's used for confirmations or error messages. 

<ShowExample example="alertDialog"/>

By adding the `alert` prop to our component, we adhere to the [WAI ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/), enabling assistive technologies to distinguish alert dialogs for special handling.

Alertdialogs do not allow the backdrop to be closed when clicked, regardless of whether the `closeOnBackdropClick` prop was set to true.

## Modal focus

One of the features that Qwik UI provides is focus locking. This refers to keeping focus within the modal component. 

<ShowExample example="hero"/>

For example, when tabbing and the modal is opened, it will loop back to the first focusable element.

> This is a default behavior that we provide out of the box, please [let us know](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/issues) if there are any additional use cases that require personalized focus lock behavior.

## Animations

<ShowExample example="animation" />

## Open on page load

There might come a time where a modal is needed open as soon as the page loads. Unfortunately, to create modals a client-side API is currently needed regardless of implementation.

### SSR dilemma

Qwik is the first framework with an [SSR portal implementation](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#solution). SSR Portal capabilities are unique to Qwik City, because the alternative frameworks require a client-side API for portal functionality, such as `document.appendChild`.

The problem with rendering the modal in the server, is that we lose some critical behavior:

- The content behind the dialog is not inert (non-modal)
- Focus and scroll lock customizations break
- Will not work with meta frameworks like Astro.js

The current solution across framework ecosystems, is to open the Modal eagerly on the client to keep the proper functionality.

<PageLoadSnip />

> We believe that the dialog element will have native support for SSR Modals in the future, gaining this behavior in the process.
