# Modal

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Modal content is placed in the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer), rendering the underneath content as [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) meaning non-interactive.

<ShowExample example="hero"/>

The modal makes use of HTML's `dialog` element, which has great browser support in [every major browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog). 

> For non-modal UI elements, it is preferred to use [Qwik UI's popover component](../../../docs/headless/popover/) *(in progress)*. In the near future, Qwik's popover component can be applied to the most-semantically-relevant HTML element, including the `<dialog>` element itself for non-modal dialogs.

Modals are used when an important choice needs to be made in the application. The rest of the content isn't interactive until a certain action has been performed.

## The dialog element

<ShowExample example="inspect"/>

The [dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) provides a native solution for modals. That said, the element itself is not fully accessible, and may not have the desired features. Qwik UI solves that problem, providing scroll & focus lock, as well as other quality of life features on top of the dialog element.

> To add dialog properties, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself. 

### The top layer

<ImgTestImage class="rounded-xl mb-6" />

In Chrome and Edge, a `top layer` attribute is shown in the dev tools. This means dialog content is placed above any other content, preventing any overflow or style issues. 

> The previous implementation of modals required the use of portals, the top layer pseudo class is a native solution to this problem.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard interaction

<KeyboardInteractionTable
  keyDescriptors={[
    {
      keyTitle: 'Escape',
      description: 'Closes the dialog.',
    },
  ]}
/>
