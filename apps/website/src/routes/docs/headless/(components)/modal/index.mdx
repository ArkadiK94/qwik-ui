# Modal

A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Modal content is placed in the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer), rendering the underneath content as [inert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) / non-interactive.

<ShowExample example="hero"/>

The modal makes use of HTML's `dialog` element, which has great browser support in [every major browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog).

> For non-modal UI elements, it is preferred to use [Qwik UI's popover component](../../../docs/headless/popover/) *(in progress)*. In the near future, Qwik's popover component can be applied to the most-semantically-relevant HTML element, including the `<dialog>` element itself for non-modal dialogs.

Modals are used when an important choice needs to be made in the application. The rest of the content isn't interactive until a certain action has been performed.

## Dialog extendability

<ShowExample example="inspect"/>

The Qwik UI Modal component is built on top of the `dialog` element. To see additional capabilities of the dialog, take a look at the [offical MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog).

> To add dialog properties, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself.

### Attribute example

<ShowExample example="autoFocus" />

Above is an example of the `autofocus` attribute used to focus the 2nd input when the dialog is opened.

> When adding properties on `<Modal />`, it is the same as sticking the attribute, class, or API on the dialog element itself.

## Open or close the modal

To open or close the modal, we can use `bind:show`, a custom signal bind that leverages the [bind](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/rendering/#bind-attribute) syntax in Qwik.

<ShowExample example="hero" />

`showSig` is a signal that we pass into our Modal component to customize when the modal can be open or closed.

The above example sets the signal to true when the button with the text **Open Modal** is clicked, then closed whenever a button inside of the modal is clicked.

> Custom signal binds can be thought of as a remote control for a television. Just as you use a remote control to change channels, adjust volume, or turn the TV on or off, custom signal binds allow you to control the state of a component, such as opening or closing a modal, from a distance.

## The top layer

<ImgTestImage class="rounded-xl mb-6" />

In Chrome and Edge, a `top layer` attribute is shown in the dev tools. This means dialog content is placed above any other content, preventing any overflow or style issues.

The top layer is used in Qwik UI, whenever a modal or popover is used. Popovers can be applied to any semantic element, modals in Qwik UI are tied to the `dialog` element.

> The previous implementation of modals required the use of [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal), the top layer pseudo class is a **native solution** to this problem. No more z-index wars!

## Backdrops

Due to the modal's implementation using the dialog, the `::backdrop` pseudo element can be used as well.
