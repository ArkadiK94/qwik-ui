# Popover

A non-modal primitive with overlays that open and close around a DOM element.

<ShowExample example="hero" />

The Qwik UI Popover component is designed to align with the [HTML Popover API Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API). As of now, native support for this API is around `63%`. To ensure consistent behavior across all browsers, Qwik UI provides a `polyfill` for browsers that do not support the API natively.

## What is a Popover?

A popover is a **non-modal** UI element that creates overlays around a DOM element. Non-modal meaning the rest of the page can be interacted with while the popover is shown.

This is particularly useful for displaying additional information or options without navigating away from the current context. It is also a **native replacement for [portals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/cookbook/portal/#portal)**, which are commonly used in other JavaScript frameworks. 

> A common use case for a popover, is preventing overflow issues within your UI. The popover API guarantees that your content remains above the rest of the page.

Most importantly, this API is a foundation for other headless components.

## Example use cases

Here are a couple of example components where the Popover API can be used. Including other parts of Qwik UI headless. Throughout the part of the documentation, we will show the Combobox being used as an example.

The content inside of Qwik UI popovers are resumable and built with Qwik in mind.

 <AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'Combobox',
      description: 'A text input that allows users to fill in values from a predefined list.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Select',
      description: 'A dropdown menu that allows users to choose one value from a list.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Context Menu',
      description: 'A menu that appears upon user interaction, such as right-clicking.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Tooltip',
      description: 'A text label that appears when a user hovers, focuses, or touches an element.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Toast',
      description: 'A small message that shows up temporarily to give the user some feedback.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Dropdown Menu',
      description: 'A list of options that appears below a button, that users can select from.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Hover Card',
      description: 'A card that appears when a user hovers over an element.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Menubar',
      description: 'A horizontal menu with clickable items.',
    },
  ]}
