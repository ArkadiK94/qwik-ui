# Accordion

A set of interactive sections that show or hide connected information.

<Showcase name="hero" />

<FeatureList
  features={[
    'Follows the WAI-Aria design pattern',
    'Full keyboard navigation',
    'Can open one or multiple items at a time',
    'Supports initial and reactive values',
  ]}
/>

      name: 'Accordion.Root',
      description: 'The primary container for the accordion.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Item',
      description: 'A single disclosure widget.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Header',
      description: 'The heading element of an accordion item.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Trigger',
      description: 'Activates to show or hide the accordion content.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Content',
      description: 'Displays the content when its connected trigger is actived.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Why use a headless accordion?

While you can create a native disclosure with HTML elements like `details` and `summary`, there are some limitations and issues with them.

### Native disclosure pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Cannot control multiple disclosures at once',
    'Inconsistent accessible name computation',
    'Unintuitive role announcements',
    'Connected information is hard to find with AT',
  ]}
/>

Qwik UI includes a headless Accordion component that uses ARIA and JavaScript to enhance accessibility and usability for managing multiple sections smoothly.

> For more information on the inconsistencies of these native elements, see Scott O'Hara's [The details and summary elements, again](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html) article.
