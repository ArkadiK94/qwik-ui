# Accordion

A set of interactive sections that show or hide connected information.

<Showcase name="hero" />

<FeatureList
  features={[
    'Follows the WAI-Aria design pattern',
    'Full keyboard navigation',
    'Can open one or multiple items at a time',
    'Supports initial and reactive values',
  ]}
/>

## Why use a headless accordion?

While you can create a native disclosure with HTML elements like `details` and `summary`, there are some limitations and issues with them.

### Native disclosure pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Cannot control multiple disclosures at once',
    'Inconsistent accessible name computation',
    'Unintuitive role announcements',
    'Connected information is hard to find with AT',
  ]}
/>

Qwik UI includes a headless Accordion component that uses ARIA and JavaScript to enhance accessibility and usability for managing multiple sections smoothly.

> For more information on the inconsistencies of these native elements, see Scott O'Hara's [The details and summary elements, again](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html) article.

## Component State

### Initial value

To set a default or initial value on page load, use the `value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="initial" />

The `value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root>` was set to `item-2`, which is the value of the second item. As a result, the second item is selected by default.

### Reactive value

Pass reactive state by using the `bind:value` prop on the `<Accordion.Root /> `component.

<Showcase name="reactive" />

### Programmatic changes

You can also change the current expanded item values programmatically by updating the signal's value.

<Showcase name="programmatic" />

### Handling selection changes

Listen to when a new item is selected by passing a callback function to the `onChange$` prop.

<Showcase name="on-change" />

### Disabled items

Items can be disabled by setting the `disabled` prop to true on the `<Accordion.Item />` component.

<Showcase name="disabled" />

> Disabled items are not selectable or focusable. They are also skipped when using the arrow keys to navigate through the items.

### Disabled Component

The component itself can also be disabled by setting the `disabled` prop to true on the `<Accordion.Root />` component.

<Showcase name="disabled-root" />

## Animation

Animations can also be added using the `--qwikui-collapsible-content-height` variable.

<Showcase name="animation" />

<CodeSnippet name="animation.css" />

## CSR

The Accordion automatically renders based on its environment. This means that it works for both server-side and client-side rendering.

<Showcase name="csr" />

## Dynamic

You have custom control over how to render items in the Accordion, allowing for dynamic rendering of items.

<Showcase name="dynamic" />

> This also updates the selected items, disabled items, and focus order automatically for you.
