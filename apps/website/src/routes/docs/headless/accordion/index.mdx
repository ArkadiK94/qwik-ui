# Accordion

A set of interactive sections that show or hide connected information.

### ðŸŽ¨ Anatomy

<AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Root',
      description: 'The primary container for the accordion.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Item',
      description: 'A single disclosure widget.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Header',
      description: 'The heading element of an accordion item.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Trigger',
      description: 'Activates to show or hide the accordion content.',
    },
    {
      name: 'Accordion.Content',
      description: 'Displays the content when its connected trigger is actived.',
    },

/>

## Why use a headless accordion?

While you can create a native disclosure with HTML elements like `details` and `summary`, there are some limitations and issues with them.

### Native disclosure pain points

<FeatureList
  issues={[
    'Cannot control multiple disclosures at once',
    'Inconsistent accessible name computation',
    'Unintuitive role announcements',
    'Connected information is hard to find with AT',
  ]}
/>

Qwik UI includes a headless Accordion component that uses ARIA and JavaScript to enhance accessibility and usability for managing multiple sections smoothly.

> For more information on the inconsistencies of these native elements, see Scott O'Hara's [The details and summary elements, again](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html) article.

## Multiple items

<Showcase name="multi" />

### Animations

The previous two examples make use of the **animated** prop. This prop allows you to use the `transition` and `animation` properties without the content immediately closing. In the future, there will be native browser support for transitioning display.

If you're curious about how the accordion is animated, you can use a built-in Qwik UI variable called **--qwikui-accordion-content-height**.

The variable calculates the content height behind the scenes, so that you can use this variable in your keyframes. Out of the box, you can use the `accordion-open` and `accordion-close` keyframes in your project. These use an `animation` declaration on the height property.

> The animation above makes use of the overflow hidden declaration. You can also check out this awesome [Cubic Bezier Tool](https://cubic-bezier.com/) to visualize the animation curve.

## Non-collapsible

<Showcase name="non-collapsible" />

By default, the <strong>collapsible</strong> prop is set to true. You can revert this behavior by setting it to false in the Accordion Root component.

## Disabled

<Showcase name="disabled" />

When disabling an accordion trigger, you're adding the default disabled browser behavior, along with removing the element from the focus order.

Any disabled elements will be skipped over when using tab or the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys. You can do this by adding the **disabled** prop on any trigger.

## Default Value

<Showcase name="default-value" />

You can make the accordion items uncontrolled by adding the **defaultValue** prop on the items. This will open an accordion item without user interaction, and can be used on both type single and multi accordions.

<Note status="warning">
**Don't try to open multiple items with single mode!**

If you're using `behavior="single"` with multiple defaultValue accordion items, the last item will be the one that opens. You may experience flickering behavior as well.

</Note>

## Custom Heading Label

<Showcase name="custom-heading" />

By default, when using the `Accordion.Header` component, it's rendered as an `h3` tag. You can render your heading of choice by using the **as** prop.

## Selected Index

<Showcase name="selected-index" />

`onSelectedIndexChange$` will keep track of the current selected index. It can be useful for when you want to programmatically change something based on a user's interaction.

## Focused Index

<Showcase name="focused-index" />

`onFocusIndexChange$` will keep track of the current focused index. It can be useful for when you want to programmatically change something based on what the user focuses.

> When a user clicks a trigger, they are also focusing it, which is worth keeping in mind when using this custom event.

## Dynamic

<Showcase name="dynamic" />

You can embrace reactivity, using signals, stores, and however else you'd like to use the Accordion with dynamic behavior.

When an Accordion Item is removed, a [Visible Task](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/tasks/#usevisibletask) runs that will clean up the DOM node in the browser, ensuring that you stay clear of race condition or memory leak issues.

> You can add or remove something at any index and the focus order will adhere to the DOM hierarchy!

<div class="my-4">
  If you'd prefer to add your own <strong>id</strong> to the Accordion Item with dynamic
  behavior, you can add the `id` prop to the Accordion Item. This can be useful when you'd
  like the id value to be sync with your custom logic.
</div>

By default, the Accordion Item has a locally scoped id with Qwik's `useId` hook. All children elements will be prefixed by its respective item id, followed by a dash and the element. For example, `{id}-trigger`.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard interaction

<KeyboardInteractionTable keyDescriptors={

  {
    keyTitle: 'Tab',
    description: 'Moves focus to the next focusable trigger.',
  },
  {
    keyTitle: 'Shift + Tab',
    description: 'Moves focus to the previous focusable trigger.',
  },
  {
    keyTitle: 'Space / Enter',
    description: 'Expand or collapse the Accordion Trigger.',
  },

## API

### Accordion Root

<APITable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'behavior',
      type: 'string',
      description:

    },
  ]}
/>

### Accordion Item

<APITable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'id',
      type: 'string',
      description:
        'Allows the consumer to supply their own id attribute for the item and its descendants.',
    },
    {
      name: 'defaultValue',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Determines whether the Accordion Item will open by default.',

### Accordion Header

<APITable

      description: 'Sets the heading tag of the Accordion Header (Rendered HTML)',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Common Built-in Props

Thanks to `QwikIntrinsicAttributes` , you can use most if not all normal JSX props and handlers on the semantically correlated component. Here are some of the most common ones:

<APITable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'class',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'CSS classes you can apply',
    },
    {
      name: 'style',
      type: 'string',
      description: 'CSS styles you can apply',
    },
    {
      name: 'disabled',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: 'Disables the element',
    },
    {
      name: 'onClick$',
      type: 'function',
      info: 'PropFunction<() => void>',
      description: 'A custom click handler that executes when the element is clicked.',
    },
    {
      name: 'onKeyDown$',
      type: 'function',
      info: 'PropFunction<() => void>',
      description: 'A custom click handler that executes when the key is pressed down.',
    },
    {
      name: 'onFocus$',
      type: 'function',
      info: 'PropFunction<() => void>',
      description: 'A custom click handler that executes when element is focused.',
    },
  ]}
/>
