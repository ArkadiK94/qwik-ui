# Styled Kit

<div class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 mt-[-8px] text-xl font-semibold">
  A fully customizable design system of copy-paste, reusable, styled components built on
  top of headless.
</div>

Inspired by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), the Styled kit is an innovative collection of pre-designed, fully customizable, and easy-to-reuse copy-paste components built with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [cva](https://cva.style/docs) and css variables.

We believe the flexibility and constraints of tailwind utility classes (with all the available tooling around tailwind), the reusability and simplicity of cva variants, and the ease of customization of css variables, are currently the best options for starting out with a good design system that can grow with you as your brand evolves and solidifies itself.

## Start with good defaults

If you've ever tried to create a design system from scratch, you should know how hard it is to find the right balance. How many variants should the button component have? Should we have 3 sizes, 4 sizes, 10? Should we include an "outline" variant? Should we allow composing "outline" variants with "color" variants or should the outline count as a sort of color?

If this feels confusing, don't worry. We consider those questions for each and every component to make sure that they're not only as easy as possible to use, but can also be used for a completely different style without having to change the code (e.g. from 'simple' to 'brutalist') üëÄ.

## Change your entire app's style & theme at the click of a button

Check out our "make it yours" button ‚ÜóÔ∏è and see how easy it is to completely change the entire design of your app. Simply copy the css-variables config to your global css file and you're ready to go.

Thanks to the super powers of copy/paste, you can start with well designed defaults but get away from them as your design system needs to evolve. Simply remove the code that you don't like and add the pieces that you need whenever you want.

## Avoid code duplication thanks to cva variants

A good design system is a system where all the variations of a component are defined within a single source of truth to represent all the possibilities within the constraints of the brand's identity. - [Ma√Øeul Chevalier](https://x.com/maiieul)

The styled kit makes use of cva variants to allow for easy composition and avoid code duplication. No ButtonSmall, ButtonMedium, ButtonLarge, ButtonPrimary, ButtonSecondary, ButtonSmallPrimary, ButtonMediumPrimary, ButtonLargePrimary, ButtonSmallSecondary, ButtonMediumSecondary, ButtonLargeSecondary ... üíÄ, but instead just one `Button` with variants as props. Isn't `<Button size="sm">` much better?
