# Checkbox

A control that allows the user to toggle between checked and not checked.

> The current implementation of the styled checkbox uses the native html `<input type="checkbox" />` element. We intend to introduce a headless checkbox with intermediary states and better handling of colors, animations, etc. in the future. In the meantime, this native element is still better than nothing ðŸ™ƒ.
